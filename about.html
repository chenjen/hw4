        <h3>Our Story:</h3>

            <p>Dawg Pizza was started in 2013 with one simple
            goal: to get the students of the University of Washington to eat
            our pizza for every single meal. Well, maybe not every single meal,
            but most of them anyway. Cold pizza is really good for breakfast.
            And who can deny that pizza for lunch is really tasty? And when
            you've had a long day of classes and you're hungry, why not order a
            pizza for dinner too? And what should you do when you get hungry
            during that late-night study session? Order a pizza! That's where
            we come in.</p>

            <p>We make the traditional pizzas, but we also mix
            things up with non-traditional ingredients. Tomato sauce is great,
            but how about plum, peanut, soy, or teriyaki sauce? You can get
            pepperoni anywhere, so how about some roasted duck or venison
            instead? Mushrooms are nice, but what about stir-fried cabbage and
            fried egg? We do it all.</p>

            <p>Our pizzas are the best in Seattle, but don't take
            our word for it. Try one and you'll see!</p>

            <h3>Our Ecological Impact:</h3>

            <p>We love the environment, and we take extra steps to
            reduce our ecological footprint. For example, we collect and burn
            only naturally fallen wood from happy trees located within 100
            miles of the restaurant. All our ingredients are fair-trade,
            organic, and residents of Washington State. Our meats come from
            animals that were named, raised in the ranchers' homes as if they
            were their children, and educated in the finest animal
            universities. The wheat for our dough is crushed by hand using a
            mortar and pestle. Our pizza boxes are made from recycled exam Blue
            Books and are guaranteed to decompose within seconds of finishing
            your pizza. We deliver using only rodent-powered vehicles and we
            all bike to work. We love the environment!</p>
